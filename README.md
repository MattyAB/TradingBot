# TradingBot

## Features
* Trading algorithm running on backtesting data
* Plots each position made into a html file
* Plots overall indicators to Exports/IndicatorExport.html
* Trains algorithm with gradient descent to optimise 

## Todo
- More indicators
- Improve decision algorithm
- Text logging
- Pulling TP and SL
- Pos logs before and after position is open
- Genetic algorithm for creating position deciding criteria (GA writes the algorithm)
- Plot that takes the avergages every n ticks to build a COMPLETE plot of all the data.
- Text logging to console and log file
- Implement trading fees
- Positions take money out of portfolio and hold them in escrow (So that positions can always be finished - at the moment sometimes we can't finish a position when we want to.)
